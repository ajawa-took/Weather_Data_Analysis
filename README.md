## Andrew's GitHub Branch for Dashboard Creation Efforts
It is not currently clear to me how to produce a dashboard of information similar to the Plotly Bellybutton module from data provided in a .csv file. It has not been possible for me to follow the skeleton code structure from the Plotly module because the data in that module was given in .json format. Consequently it's difficult/currently impossible to transfer knowledge/skills gained in a class module to the group project.
## Outline of my efforts
I have registered for an account on PythonAnywhere, attempted to run a Flask-based file on a web page.
Lily and I have invested a lot of time trying to incorportate Module 12 Plotly knowledge into a web dashboard from a .csv file provided by Alice and Laurina who have been our data creation/manipulation/transformation team. Our efforts so far have been frustrated by our inability to fully understand the .js code from the module.
