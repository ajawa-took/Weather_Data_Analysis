### Andrew's GitHub Branch for Dashboard Creation Efforts
It is not currently clear to me how to produce a dashboard of information similar to the Plotly Bellybutton module from data provided in a .csv file. It has not been possible for me to follow the skeleton code structure from the Plotly module because the data in that module was given in .json format. Consequently it's difficult/currently impossible to transfer knowledge/skills gained in a class module to the group project.
