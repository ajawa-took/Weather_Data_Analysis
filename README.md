## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze the past weather data for a given location within a given range of dates-of-the-year (e.g. London, UK averaged 5 rainy days between March 25 and April 3 in the past 17 years) to predict the weather of that location. The interactive dashboard presents analysis of the weather data, including temperature, rainfall, snowllfall, windspeed, humidity, and cloudiness. So a front-end user could access our website and utilize the tool to retrieve instant and informative weather information about a given location for trip planning.
